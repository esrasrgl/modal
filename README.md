## Bugs

During test writing, even if `act` is not used explicitly, `screen` and `render` may use `act` in the background.

:warning: **Warning**: ReactDOMTestUtils.act is deprecated in favor of React.act. Import act from react instead of react-dom/test-utils. See https://react.dev/warnings/react-dom-test-utils for more info.

**Solution**:
To resolve this issue, install the latest version of `@testing-library/react`:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react
```
